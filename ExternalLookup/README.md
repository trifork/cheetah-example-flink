 # ExternalLookup

This respository contains a templated flink job. Processing is handled by Apache Flink which is a statefull scalable stream processing framework. You can find more information about Apache Flink [here](https://flink.apache.org/).

The flink job consumes a kafka topic with simple messages, enriches this message and published the enriched message on another kafka topic.

## Project structure

The following list explains some of the major components of the project, in order to familiarize newcomers with the structure:

- `/src` - Java source code containing the Flink job
  - `main` - Source code for the job itself
  - `test` - Unit tests for the job
- `/ComponentTest` - .NET test project, which is used for component testing the Flink job
  - `Dockerfile` - to allow testing within Docker
- `Dockerfile` - for building the Flink job.
- `docker-compose.yaml` - allows running the Flink job and component test within Docker, with necessary environment values, port bindings, etc. for local development.
- `pom.xml` - Project Object Model, which defines how to build the Flink job, which dependencies it requires and necessary plugins for building and testing.
- `README.md` - This file
- `settings.xml` - Settings file used to configure access to the Maven Package Repository.

## Prerequisites

This project depends on maven packages that are located on the
Cheetah Maven Repository on github,
and thus requires access to the Cheetah Maven Repository on Github.
To enable access you need to get create a personal token by going to
[https://github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
and creating a token with the `read:packages` scope.

To run the docker containers you need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_ACTOR=your-github-username # replace with your github username
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token # replace with the token you generated in the previous paragraph
```

Then verify that you're able to build docker images by running:

```bash
docker compose build
```

## Local development

For local development, you will need to clone the [cheetah-development-infrastructure](https://github.com/trifork/cheetah-development-infrastructure) repository. 

You'll then be able to run necessary infrastructure with the following command from within that repository:

```bash
docker compose --profile kafka up -d
```

This will start `kafka`, `keycloak` , `schema-registry` (used for AVRO schemas) and `redpanda`, which can be used to inspect what topics and messages exist in `kafka`. 

Redpanda can be accessed on [http://localhost:9898](http://localhost:9898).

You need to create the source topics which the flink job reads from. This is done by setting the `INITIAL_KAFKA_TOPICS` to `ExternalLookupInputTopic` before running the `kafka-setup` container in `cheetah-development-infrastructure`:
```powershell
$env:INITIAL_KAFKA_TOPICS="ExternalLookupInputTopic"; docker compose up kafka-setup -d
```
The `kafka-setup` service is also run when starting kafka using the above command, but running it seperately enables you to create the topics with an already running Kafka.
Alternatively you can create the topics manually in Redpanda.

`cheetah-development-infrastructure` contains more than just the services that the above command starts, but running the entire infrastructure setup takes up a fair amount of resources on your local system. 

If you need to run other services like OpenSearch, please see the documentation in the `development-infrastructure` repository.

## Run/debug job (IntelliJ)

When developing your job you can run/debug it like any other Java application by running the `main` method in ExternalLookupJob.

### Create intellij run profile for ExternalLookupJob.java with parameters

Program arguments:
```
--kafka-bootstrap-servers localhost:9092
--input-kafka-topic ExternalLookupInputTopic
--output-kafka-topic ExternalLookupOutputTopic
```
Environment variables:
```
- KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=default-access
- KAFKA_CLIENT_SECRET=default-access-secret
- KAFKA_SCOPE=kafka
- KAFKA_TOKEN_URL=http://localhost::1852/realms/local-development/protocol/openid-connect/token
```

## Tests
### Unit tests

This project contains a sample Unit test in `src/test/java/Externallookup/job/ExternalLookupMapperTest.java`, which utilizes JUnit5.

Unit tests are automatically run as part of the build processing when building the Flink job through either `mvn`, IntelliJ or Docker.

### Component test

This project contains a .NET test project under `/ComponentTest`, which you can use to verify that your job acts as you expect it to.

You can both these tests both from your preffered IDE using the `.sln` file, and through docker.

In order to run both your job and the component tests at once, simply run `docker compose up --build` from the root directory of the repository.

Alternatively, if you just want to run your job from docker compose and run the component tests manually through your IDE, run the following command:

```sh
docker compose up externallookup-job externallookup-job-taskmanager --build
```

Similarly, you can run just the component test through docker compose using:
```sh
docker compose up externallookup-test --build
```

If doing so, make sure to run your job locally from IntelliJ before starting the component test.

#### Persisted data during development

You might encounter failing component tests due to your job receiving more messages than expected. This occurs if you've previously run the job and component tests and data is still present in Kafka. The component test will then, in some cases, re-read the output of previous runs.

To fix this, you'll need to delete the data in Kafka by running: `docker compose down` in the `cheetah-development-infrastructure` repository and then starting it again using the command in [Local development with docker-compose](#local-development). This deletes the volume containing Kafka's data and starts everything up again.

#### Concurrent tests

While .NET allows running multiple tests in parallel, it is generally a difficult task to ensure that a Flink job correctly handles receiving data intended for testing multiple different "scenarios" at once.

This is a fairly complicated topic to explain accurately, which involves both the way Flink handles incoming messages and how time progresses from the perspective of a Flink Job. The Flink documentation is generally good at explaining many of these nuances - A solid place to start would be: [Timely Stream Processing | Apache Flink](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.16/docs/concepts/time/).

The general recommendation is to avoid running multiple component tests at the same time. You _may_ be able to run multiple tests in succession, but, depending on the implementation and requirements of both the job and the test, your mileage may wary.

Because of this component testing should, in most scenarios, be kept to testing the job generally (primary functionality, correct input/output models, etc.) while ensuring the finer details of the implementation with unit tests.

# Implementing a new Flink job

## What is a job?

A job in Flink consists of a number of sources, a number of sinks, and a number of transformation steps.

From each source you will get a stream. This stream can be transformed, split, or combined with other streams. Each transformation will take a stream as input and return a stream that can be used as an input for another transformation or sent to a sink.

Some process functions (transformation) can combine two sources. By specifying a common property in `keyBy` it is ensured that related events from the two sources will run in the same thread and have access to the same state. An example could be data enrichment where a main stream is combined with a secondary stream, returning a new stream enriched by data from the secondary stream.

Besides the main stream returned from a process function, some type of functions can generate side outputs which will generate secondary streams that can be consumed by other transformations or sinks. This allows for functions to generate multiple events from a single event.

## KISS

The job should have minimum responsibility and business logic. Better to have multiple, simple jobs with a small amount of responsibility, than a single, complex job.

In most scenarios, output data should be stored in a Kafka topic. This makes it possible for others to consume the data your job outputs. 

If data needs to be persisted in a database for direct query by some other service, this should be done by the standard storage job.

## TDD

An approach proven to be good, is to start by writing a unit test for the processing job under development.
Then proceed in micro iterations, carefully assert expected output and behavior.
The project includes several examples for JUnit tests.

It is not recommended to use Mockto, since Flick is not happy about it and will produce unstable results.
